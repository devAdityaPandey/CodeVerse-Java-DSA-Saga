SORTING : 

Arrange in an order.

Basic Algorithms : 

Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Counting Sort (Advanced) 

Bubble Sort : 

{5, 4, 1, 3, 2} unsorted array
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} increasing order
{5, 4, 3, 2, 1} decreasing order 

Idea : 

large elements come to the end of array by swapping with adjacent elements 

Selection Sort : 

Idea : 

pick the smallest (from unsorted), put it at the beginning 

Insertion Sort : 

Pick an element(from unsorted part) & place in the right pos in sorted part 

Inbuilt Sort : 

import.java.util.Arrays;
Arrays.sort(arr)
O(n logn)

Arrays.sort(arr, si, ei)
